##### @spolsky sharing one of the key anecdotes of his early career as an entrepreneur

„A summer intern came up with the idea to put job ads on joelonsoftware. That turned out to be an unbelievable successful idea. It probably made us around one million dollars in the first year.“

##### What’s the difference between a good and a great developer?

Joel Spolsky: I know how to turn a great developer into a mediocre one: Put him into an open-floor office and turn the noise up.

##### How can a tech company attract talented developers?

Joel: Finding the right developer as a company is a bit like dating. You don’t want to look for the one out of this world genius. It makes a lot more sense to find the perfect match.
